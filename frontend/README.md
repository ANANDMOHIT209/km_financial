## Getting Started with Create React App

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then, install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm install react-spring
npm install @mui/x-charts
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Step 2: Start the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will launch the application in your default web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Note:

- If you encounter any issues or want to reset your dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules && npm install
```
